### Hi there, it's HritayanðŸ‘‹ [Hritayan Debnath]
ML/DL Enthusiast | Data Science | Computer Vision

As a Data Science / Machine Learning learner, I am passionate about using data to answer hard questions, delivering robust code and software and optimising and automating processes with data pipelines. I habitually collaborate with others to help us seek difficult problems together.I focus on developing and applying advanced analytical and statistical tools that automate conventional workflows with big data. Make decision based on knowledge, not intuition.These models are helpful to analyse data to simplify class recognition, automated interpretation and discern cause-and-effect correlation. Furthermore I create, execute, maintain and improve complex systems in order to support organisations whose research and success depend on accurate prediction.
